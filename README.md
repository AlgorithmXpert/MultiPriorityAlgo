# MultiPriorityAlgo
This repository contains code for the research on optimizing Multi-Priority Queues in the SPMA protocol for Tactical Network Communications. It uses Markov queuing theory for performance analysis and applies Deep Reinforcement Learning to optimize Channel Occupancy Statistics (COS) and protocol parameters.
