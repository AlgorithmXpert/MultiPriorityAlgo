# MultiPriorityAlgo
This repository contains code for the research on optimizing Multi-Priority Queues in the SPMA protocol for Tactical Network Communications. It uses Markov queuing theory for performance analysis and applies Deep Reinforcement Learning to optimize Channel Occupancy Statistics (COS), Threshold (TH) values, backoff schemes and other protocol parameters.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The project focuses on optimizing Multi-Priority Queues within the SPMA protocol (Statistically Prioritized Multi-Access Protocol) to improve data transmission performance in tactical network communications. SPMA, known for its efficient channel resource utilization, is further enhanced in this study by optimizing queue management and protocol parameters to boost system performance.

The core implementation of this repository includes simulation models based on Markov queuing theory, used to calculate key performance metrics such as packet success rates and average delays. Additionally, Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) is applied to optimize key parameters such as Channel Occupancy Statistics (COS), Threshold (TH) values, and backoff schemes to accommodate multi-priority traffic demands. Deep RL automatically adjusts these parameters to improve overall system response time and throughput.

The simulation environment and optimization models in this repository are especially suited for tactical networks and multi-hop wireless communication scenarios, aiming to enhance network transmission efficiency and robustness in dynamic, unpredictable environments. This research aims to provide insights into improving network performance in challenging communication scenarios.

The code is publicly available, and contributions and improvements from researchers and developers are welcomed. Collaborators are encouraged to engage with the project to further optimize the SPMA protocol and extend its applications in tactical communication systems.
*Currently part of the code has been in the library, not uploaded code will be uploaded as soon as possible
